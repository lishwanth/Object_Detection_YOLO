# Object Detection with YOLO

## Overview

This project implements Object Detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a real-time object detection system. YOLO divides an image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. It's known for its speed and accuracy.

## Features

- YOLOv8 implementation for object detection.
- Pre-trained weights for quick setup and testing.
- Supports multiple object classes.
- Easy-to-use and well-documented code.
